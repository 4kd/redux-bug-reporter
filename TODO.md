# TODO:
## Pre-launch:
* Squash commits to one initial commit
* Badges
* Publish beta to npm
* Verify it works with debt tool

## Post-launch:
* React-storybook examples
* Google sheets integration
* Demo that stores bugs in memory, or takes a config that writes to mongodb or anything else
* Demo should split screen, have a fake app on the right and "receive bugs on the left"
* Demo will have a toggle to submit the bug to google docs, server on localhost (only if in livereload), or just to the right of the page
* Demo in livereload should accept posts to the server, as well as poll the bugs list periodically
* Demo should have some sort of network request that we can demonstrate isn't called during playback
* 100% code coverage
* Escape key closes redux-bug-reporter if it's open?
* Blog post
