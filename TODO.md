# TODO:
* React-storybook examples
* Integrations with documentation: Google sheets, jira, console logging, asana, pivotal tracker, github issues
* Example server implementation that stores bugs in memory, or takes a config that writes to mongodb or anything else
* 100% code coverage
* Escape key closes redux-bug-reporter if it's open?
* Blog post
* Demo video
* If bug submission fails, offer to log to the console instead so the user can manually contact the developer
